## About Me
I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Foreign Philology, but throughout my studies, I realized that I did not want to build a career in this field.

During my journey of self-discovery and exploring new career paths, I became deeply interested in frontend development. I am fascinated by how ideas can be brought to life through interactive and visually appealing web pages. I am passionate about the process of building websites and am inspired by the opportunity to solve challenges using technology.

I possess strong analytical thinking skills, am detail-oriented, and am eager to acquire new skills. Continuous growth and improvement are important to me, and I am committed to advancing my knowledge in programming with the goal of building a successful career in IT. I am ready to learn intensively and put in the effort required to achieve my objectives.
